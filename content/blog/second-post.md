# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post! I'm using **markdown** with frontmatter to create blog posts.

## Features

Here are some cool features:

- Markdown rendering
- Syntax highlighting for code
- Frontmatter support
- Automatic blog post discovery

## Code Example

Here's a TypeScript code example:

```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

function greetUser(user: User): string {
  return `Hello, ${user.name}!`;
}

const user: User = {
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john@example.com"
};

console.log(greetUser(user));
```

## JavaScript Example

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map(n => n * 2);
console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

## Styling

You can use *italic*, **bold**, and `inline code`.

> This is a blockquote. Pretty cool, right?

### Lists Work Too

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

That's all for now. Happy blogging!
